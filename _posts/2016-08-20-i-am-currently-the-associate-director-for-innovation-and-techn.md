I am currently the Associate Director for Innovation & Technology at Tamana's Research Center, New Delhi. Post my Engineering in Computer Science from[Allahabad][0] and postgraduate studies in Artificial Intelligence from [Scotland][1]; I joined Tamana, a non-profit to instigate a technology research lab which could provide rich technological resources (assistive aids) to assist the special needs community.

Since 2013, I have worked with [Deakin University, Australia][2] (_on TOBY an iPad based application_), IBM Research (_on Embodied learning & Joint Attention_) and NIOS Research (_for creating Virtual content focusing on MOOCs for special needs_). We are currently working with Microsoft (_on IT Skill development_), [Google][3](_on Google for Education for special needs_) and the MoSJE (on VR based skill development training on Solar lantern and Bio Fertilizers). On 11th February 2015, my team was presented the [Catalytic Grant for the ICT based Social Innovation][4] by NASSCOM Foundation for developing a Kinect based educational application to help individuals with Autism and special needs at its Social Innovation Forum 2015\. Media links can be found [here][5], [here][6] and [here][7]. In October 2015, I led a UX validation of the [7 Braille Keyboard][8] by [Kriyate][9] at the National Association of Blind, New Delhi.
